# Titanic EDA Project 🚢

This project is part of my Elevvo Pathways internship, where I explored the Titanic dataset using Python to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## 📊 Objective
To uncover insights about passenger survival using statistical analysis and visualizations.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Survivors were generally **younger**
- **Females** and **1st-class passengers** had higher survival rates
- **Higher fare** correlated with better survival chances

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📎 Visualizations
- KDE plot (Fare vs Survival)
- Bar plots (Gender & Class vs Survival)
- Correlation heatmap

## 📁 Dataset
[Titanic Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
